## 🔍 Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

All repositories in the a-ariff organization implement:

- ✅ **CodeQL Analysis** - Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities

- ✅ **Secret Scanning** - Detection of exposed credentials and API keys
- ✅ **Container Scanning** - Docker image vulnerability assessment
- ✅ **Infrastructure as Code Scanning** - Terraform/ARM template security analysis

### Development Security Practices

- 🔐 **Branch Protection** - Main branches require pull request reviews
- 🔑 **Access Controls** - Principle of least privilege for repository access
- 📝 **Code Reviews** - All changes reviewed before merging
- 🧪 **Security Testing** - Automated and manual security testing
- 📊 **Continuous Monitoring** - Regular security assessments

### Dependency Management

- 📦 **Dependency Scanning** - Regular vulnerability assessments
- 🔄 **Automated Updates** - Security patches applied automatically
- 📋 **Dependency Pinning** - Specific versions to ensure reproducibility
- 🔍 **License Compliance** - Verification of dependency licenses

## 🎯 Security Scope

### In Scope

- **Source Code Vulnerabilities** - Code injection, XSS, authentication bypasses
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities** - Third-party package security issues
- **Configuration Issues** - Insecure default configurations
- **Infrastructure Security** - Docker, Terraform, and deployment configurations
- **Authentication/Authorization** - Access control vulnerabilities
